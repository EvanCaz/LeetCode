This is done in JS, uses concepts of prototypes and inherting and shit

var checkIfInstanceOf = function(obj, classFunction) {
    // the obj can be null starting out, but also once it becomes null that means the prototype chain is broken and there is no path from the classFunction and obj
    while(obj != null) {
        if(obj.constructor === classFunction){
            return true; // we found the link
        }
        obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj); // get next obj that cur obj inherits from
    }
    return false; // it was never found
};
